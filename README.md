# flinkedlist

## flinkedlist, Fortran Linked List 

- flinkedlist is a pure Fortran library providing an  simple linked list.
- flinkedlist is OOP designed.
- flinkedlist has some useful features like below.
  - sort elements(which is called `node` in this library) by user defined function
  - apply user defined function in each `node`.
  - Includes a convenience method to aid printf debugging by automatically displaying variables of built-in types and providing a dedicated display function for user-defined types.
  - By using the `node_operator_type` type to manipulate list elements, users can use the list data type without worrying about the internal details of the type.
  - List elements can be converted to arrays of type `node_operator_array`, so you can choose an array-like access method for list elements.

## Build
```bash
pip install fpm
git clone https://github.com/sakamoti/flinkedlist.git
cd flinkedlist

# build and run test program
fpm test
```

To use `flinkedlist` within your fpm project, add the following to your `fpm.toml` file:
```bash
[dependencies]
flinkedlist = {git = "https://github.com/sakamoti/flinkedlist.git"}
```

## DOCUMENT

If you don't have documentation tool, you should first install
[`ford`](https://forddocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
```bash
pip install ford
```
Then, auto generated documentation is available.
```bash
ford flinkedlist-doc-ford-settings.md
```

## USAGE
